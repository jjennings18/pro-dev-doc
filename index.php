		<h1> <strong>Quantitative:</strong></h1>
			<ul>
				<li> Kept track of 50+ inmates and their daily habits(meal times, laundry, exchange, etc.)</li>
				<li> Put in almost double the hours of work than the average hours worked by my graduating class
				for the first year.</li>2
				<li>Had lowest amount of negative codes called in my unit.</li>
			</ul>
		<h1> <strong>Qualitative:</strong></h1>
			<ul>
				<li>Good Organization skills</li>
				<li>Great time management skills</li>
				<li>Great people skills</li>
			</ul>
		<p>A few ways I like to try and keep a healthy balance between quantitative and qualitative brain
			functions is by reading, exercising,  socializing with friends.
			I like to read many different kinds of material(books,blogs,news articles,etc.)</p>
		<p> <strong>Why:</strong> I want to know why a webpage works from the inside out. I want to be
		able to build a workable public webpage.</p>

		<p> <strong>How:</strong> By learning code</p>
		<p> <strong>What:</strong> Attending School</p>
		<p> <strong>Elevator pitch:</strong> Hi my name is Jermain, I am currently attending school to learn how to code
		so I am able to learn what it takes to make a website function properly and securely. Do you have any ideas for
		a website that could be launched or know of an existing website that could use some tuning up?</p>

		<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
		<h2>Week 0</h2>
		<p>This week I got clarification on HTML and basic coding practices.
			I learned about the difference between quantitative and qualitative qualites and how to apply them when
			marketing myself to a potential employer. I learned the difference bewtween both frontend and backend design
			and how they mesh together to make a fully functional webpage. Last but not least I learned about Dev Tools
			and how it can be used to help discover the code on a website and even be used to help make your own website.</p>
		<h2>week 1</h2>
		<p>This week we dove deeper into looking into both frontend and backend development.
			I learned about object oriented development and how to really think about user interaction and experience when
		developing a website or application. I was showed a few different tools to help make a rough draft or blueprint
			for how I would want my website to look. I also learned how start a database in php storm and write statments
		in Mysql.</p>

		<h2>week 2</h2>
		<p>This week we learned abous CSS and the a few of the diffenert uses and components that inside CSS to make a more attractive
		webpage. We learned about box sizing property and flex box, I played the flexboxfroggy game and felt like I was able to
		comprhend the material a lot better than just reading it or being told about it. On friday we were given out capstone
			projects and learned what groups we would be working in.</p>

		<h2>Week 3</h2>
			<p>This week we learned about how our capstone projects are broken up into different sections called tickes. We
			also learned about the steps taken to have a ticket burned. We took a look at unit testing and how to impliment
			it into our capstone projects. We also took a deeper look into CSS with the CSS challenge and how to apply flexbox
			for best use on projects. We then went into taking a brief look into Bootstrap4 and were given a challenge assignment.
				Lastly I learned what my first assignment was for my portion of the group capstone project.</p>

		<h3>Board Game Reflection</h3>
		<p> Playing the board game was fun, it taught us how to work togather and listen to eachothers ideas. It showed us
		that its always better to have someone take another look at things because they may see a problem or issue that
		you didnt take into account when making decisions.</p>
