		<h1> <strong>Quantitative:</strong></h1>
			<ul>
				<li> Kept track of 50+ inmates and their daily habits(meal times, laundry, exchange, etc.)</li>
				<li> Put in almost double the hours of work than the average hours worked by my graduating class
				for the first year.</li>2
				<li>Had lowest amount of negative codes called in my unit.</li>
			</ul>
		<h2> <strong>Qualitative</strong></h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Good Organization skills</li>
				<li>Great time management skills</li>
				<li>Great people skills</li>
			</ul>
		<p>A few ways I like to try and keep a healthy balance between quantitative and qualitative brain
			functions is by reading, exercising,  socializing with friends.
			I like to read many different kinds of material(books,blogs,news articles,etc.)</p>
		<p> <strong>Why:</strong> I want to know why a webpage works from the inside out. I want to be
		able to build a workable public webpage.</p>

		<p> <strong>How:</strong> By learning code</p>
		<p> <strong>What:</strong> Attending School</p>
		<p> <strong>Elevator pitch:</strong> Hi my name is Jermain, I am currently attending school to learn how to code
		so I am able to learn what it takes to make a website function properly and securely. Do you have any ideas for
		a website that could be launched or know of an existing website that could use some tuning up?</p>
