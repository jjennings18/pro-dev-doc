		<p> <strong>Quantitative:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li> Kept track of 50+ inmates and their daily habits(meal times, laundry, exchange, etc.)</li>
				<li> Put in almost double the hours of work than the average hours worked by my graduating class
				for the first year.</li>
				<li>Had lowest amount of negative codes called in my unit.</li>
			</ul>
		<p> <strong>Qualitative</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Good Organization skills</li>
				<li>Great time management skills</li>
				<li>Great people skills</li>
			</ul>
		<p>A few ways I like to try and keep a healthy balance between quantitative and qualitative brain
			functions is by reading, exercising,  socializing with friends.
			I like to read many different kinds of material(books,blogs,news articles,etc.)</p>
		<p> <strong>Why:</strong> I want to know why webpages work from the inside out. I want to be
		able to build a workable public webpage.</p>
