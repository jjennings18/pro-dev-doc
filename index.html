		<p> <strong>Elevator pitch:</strong> Hi my name is Jermain, I am currently attending school to learn how to code
		so I am able to learn what it takes to make a website function properly and securely. Do you have any ideas for
		a website that could be launched or know of an existing website that could use some tuning up?</p>
